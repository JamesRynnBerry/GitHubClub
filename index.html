    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <script src="script.js"></script> 
    <h1>Bio!</h1>
    <p>My name is James Berry, I was born in New York City and I'm excited to start learning and implementing some code!</p>
    <h2>Professional Goals</h2>
    <p>I joined Flatiron in order to become a software engineer in order to support myself as a writer. Currently I'm working on my first book (a graphic novel).</p>
    <p>If I could pick any jobsite to metriculate into after graduating from Flatiron, at least after hopefully graduating from Flatiron, it would be the video game industry. I think it's the perfect synthesis of creative and narrative writing being built alongside coding and engineering.  </p>
